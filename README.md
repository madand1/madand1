## About Me

Hi there! 👋 I am passionate about **technology** and **aviation**, two fields that have fascinated me for as long as I can remember. I love staying up to date with the latest technological trends and seeing how they are transforming the world around us. Aviation, on the other hand, captivates me from both a technical and operational perspective; the precision, engineering, and coordination involved in flying are truly remarkable to me.

## What I Do in My Free Time

When I’m not diving into the world of technology or following advancements in aviation, I dedicate my time to **researching new management models**. I’m particularly interested in how mechanical and engineering principles can be applied to managing teams and projects. To me, mechanics isn't just about how machines work—it's also about how we can use those same principles to optimize efficiency in other fields, like administration.

## Hobbies

Beyond my passion for tech and aviation, I enjoy **lifting heavy things** 🏋️‍♂️. I train regularly because I find weightlifting to be a great way to release energy and improve my focus.

On a different note, I'm an avid reader of **manga** and deeply enjoy **stories that go beyond the reach of human capability** as we know it today. Whether it’s science fiction, fantasy, or otherworldly adventures, I love immersing myself in narratives that challenge the limits of what we consider possible. These stories inspire me to think beyond current boundaries and imagine a future full of endless possibilities.

## Contact
